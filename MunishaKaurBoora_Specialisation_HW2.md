1. What are you building?
- Our project involves creating a revision app consisting of multiple quizzes. For instance, in our app, we will include a quiz on classes and another on decorators.
- When our application is run, an individual would be presented with all possible categories. Upon selecting a category, an individual would be presented with all of the questions within that particular category. As an individual answers a question, their score would increase by 1 for each question answered correctly. After completing a quiz, the overall score for the quiz would be displayed. 
- To create the application, we will create an API, use MySQL, and write the logic in python. As an additional goal, we aim to create a frontend using HTML, JavaScript and CSS.
