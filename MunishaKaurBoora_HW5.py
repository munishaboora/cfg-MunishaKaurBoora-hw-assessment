SCRUM CEREMONIES
· Product backlog refinement
   - Product backlog refinement is the act of adding detail, estimates, and order to items in the product backlog. 
   - This is an ongoing process in which the product owner and the development team come together to discuss the details of the items in the product backlog. 
   - During product backlog refinement, items are reviewed and revised. 
   - The product backlog is essentially a list of improvements to be made to one's product.

· Sprint planning 
   - Sprint planning is an event in scrum where the team determines the items to be in the product backlog which they will work on during the upcoming sprint.  
   - Plans for how the items in the product backlog will be completed are also discussed.
   
· Daily scrum
   - A daily scrum meeting is a 15-minute event for the developers of the scrum team.
   - The meeting typically takes place at the same time and place every working day of the sprint.
   - The purpose of the daily scrum meeting is to ensure progress towards the sprint goal.
   - In the daily scrum meeting the development team would produce an actionable plan for the next working day. 
   
· Sprint review
   - The sprint review is a scrum event that takes place at the end of the sprint (but before the retrospective). 
   - The purpose of the sprint review is for the scrum team to show what they have accomplished during the sprint to key stakeholders.
   - The sprint review is also used to determine whether or not any alterations are to be made to the product in the future. 
   
· Sprint retrospective
   - The sprint retrospective is a meeting held at the end of a sprint -  it is usually the last thing done in a sprint.
      - Many teams will hold a sprint retrospective it immediately after the sprint review.
   - The purpose of the sprint retrospective is to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness.
      - It is an opportunity for the scrum team to reflect and plan improvements that should be made during the next sprint.
   - The scrum team would normally discuss what went well during the sprint, the problems that were encountered, and how those problems were resolved (if they were).
